                                             (CISA) recently issued two alerts addressing risks
                                             from Russian State-Sponsored cyber threats and
                                             highlighting recent malicious cyber incidents
                                             suffered by public and private entities in
                                             Ukraine. Credit unions are included as potential

                                             Given current
                                             geopolitical events, the NCUA, along with CISA,
                                             the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the
                                             National Security Agency encourage credit unions
                                             and their cybersecurity teams nationwide to adopt
                                             a heightened state of awareness and to conduct
                                             proactive threat hunting. In addition,
                                             COVID-related supply chain disruptions may require
                                             management to reevaluate previously held
                                             assumptions for business continuity and disaster
                                             recovery plans.

                                             Credit union leadership should be aware of
                                             critical cyber risks and take urgent steps to
                                             reduce the likelihood and impact of a potentially
                                             damaging compromise. We highly recommend that you
                                             review the two CISA issuances linked above and act
                                             on the applicable recommendations. It is crucial
                                             that your credit union does its part to improve
                                             its resilience, reducing the risk of compromise or
                                             severe business degradation. The NCUA recently
                                             created the Automated Cybersecurity Evaluation
                                             Toolbox (ACET) for federally insured credit unions
                                             to evaluate their cybersecurity posture. For more

                     Question and Answer
                  </h3>
                  <p><strong>Q:</strong>If a husband and wife are joint on an account, and the husband deposits $11,000 in cash to the account, do I include the wife on the CTR?</p>
                  <p><strong>A:</strong>Yes, as a joint owner on the account, she would be considered benefiting from the transaction.</p>
                  <p><strong>Q:</strong>If a husband and wife are joint on an account and each come in separately and deposit $6,000 cash on the same day, do I need to file a CTR?</p>
                  <p><strong>A:</strong>Yes, this is both a multiple persons and multiple transactions CTR.  Since both husband and wife are joint on the account, they would benefit from any deposits into the account and multiple cash deposits are aggregated together.</p>
                  <p><strong>Q:</strong>If a husband and wife have separate deposit accounts and the husband and wife each take out $6,000 in cash on the same day, is a CTR required?</p>
                  <p><strong>A:</strong>CTR’s are required if the credit union processes currency transactions greater than $10,000 that was performed by, of, or for the benefit of one person.  In this case a CTR may not be required unless you know the husband or wife is making the withdrawal for the other.  It is also possible they are attempting to structure the transaction to avoid the reporting requirements.  If this is a pattern of behavior and not a 1-time occurrence, then a SAR is advisable.</p>
                  <p><strong>Q:</strong>If the husband makes a deposit of $4,000 cash to his individual account, and later in the same day his wife makes a $6,500 cash deposit to their joint account, do we file a CTR?</p>
                  <p><strong>A:</strong>Yes. The transactions must be aggregated if they are by or on behalf of the same person and the credit union has knowledge of them. Deposits to joint accounts are considered to be on behalf of all the owners of the account.  In this case it would be both a multiple person and multiple transactions CTR.</p>
